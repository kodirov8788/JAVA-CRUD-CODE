# CRUD Operations in Java (API Documentation)

This repository contains a Java-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application demonstrating how to perform basic operations on a resource (e.g., `Student` entity) using a RESTful API.  

The application is built using **Spring Boot** and **Hibernate**, along with a **MySQL** database for persistence.

## Overview
This project provides a simple way to understand how to build a RESTful API in Java using Spring Boot. The API manages a **Student** entity, with the following fields:
- `id` (Long): Unique identifier (Auto-generated)
- `name` (String): Name of the student
- `email` (String): Email address of the student
- `dob` (Date): Date of birth of the student
- `age` (Integer): Calculated age based on `dob`

The application covers:
- **Create** a student (POST)
- **Read** student data (GET)
- **Update** student data (PUT)
- **Delete** a student (DELETE)

---

## Technologies Used
- **Java** 11 or later
- **Spring Boot** 3.x
- **Hibernate** (JPA for ORM)
- **MySQL** (Database)
- **Maven** (Dependency Management)
- **Postman** (or `curl` for testing)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **Java 11+** installed.
2. **MySQL** database running.
3. **Maven** installed.

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kodirov/JAVA-CRUD-CODE.git
   cd JAVA-CRUD-CODE
   ```

2. Configure the `application.properties` file:
   Update the file in `src/main/resources`:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/student
   spring.datasource.username=your_mysql_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_mysql_password

   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```sh
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

The application will start at `http://localhost:8080`.
